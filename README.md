This project showcases a robust and scalable solution for automating modifications in Microsoft Word (.docx) documents using Python.
Designed to reduce the need for repetitive manual edits, the automation enables users to dynamically update Word files based on structured external data sources such as Excel spreadsheets. 
This approach is especially useful for generating or updating large sets of documents with consistent formatting and customized content.

*Key Features*
- Automates content updates in .docx files through Python scripting
- Integrates seamlessly with Excel data for dynamic, data-driven document generation
- Enables bulk editing and document customization at scale
- Ideal for business, administrative, legal, or educational workflows involving high-volume Word document processing

*Technologies Used*
1) Python 3.x – Core language for scripting and automation
2) Python-docx – Python library to create, modify, and extract information from Word documents
3) Python-pandas - to read data from excel
